# Programming (Java Fundamentals & Algorithms)
Java applications implementing core concepts and algorithms with procedural, object-oriented, and event-driven paradigms, including debugging and coding standards.


This project demonstrates the use of **core Java programming concepts** and algorithms while applying different programming paradigms and debugging practices.

##  Project Overview
- Implemented applications using **procedural, object-oriented, and event-driven paradigms**.  
- Applied algorithms such as **binary search** to improve efficiency over brute-force approaches.  
- Practiced **debugging techniques** to resolve syntax, logic, and runtime errors.  
- Followed **coding standards** (naming conventions, indentation, comments) to improve readability and maintainability.  

##  Technologies Used
- Java  
- IDE (Eclipse)  

##  Project Structure
- `*.java` → Source code demonstrating procedural, OOP, and event-driven paradigms.  
- `Programming Report` → Documentation of the programming paradigms, algorithms, debugging process, and coding standards.  

##  Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened foundation in **problem-solving** and **algorithm design**.  
- Improved skills in **writing clean, robust, and maintainable code**.  
- Learned to apply **debugging** and **coding standards** for secure and scalable applications.
